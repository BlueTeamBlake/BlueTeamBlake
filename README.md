Some fun facts; I absolutely love hockey and played for 15 years competitively before too many injuries. I'm a super geek at video games, usually ranking in top 1% fps and I have a maxed runescape account (Played since 2002), which is also where I learned about phishing, hacking and social engineering at a young age.
